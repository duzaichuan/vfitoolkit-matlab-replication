# vfitoolkit-matlab-replication
Codes that use the VFI Toolkit to replicate existing papers. Replication is here considered to mean reproduce all tables and graphs (that are based on model).

Each folder contains a replication of a paper: to use them run the file named after the paper (AuthorsYear.m), it will do everything (calling all the other scripts) and generate all the tables and figures as saved files. 

Each folder also contains a pdf that summarizes all the results with a brief outline of the model equations, the original and replication verions of all tables and figures, and a few comments relating to the replication.

Submissions of codes replicating papers are most welcome.

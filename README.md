# vfitoolkit-matlab-replication
Codes that use the VFI Toolkit to replicate existing papers. Replication is here considered to mean reproduce all tables and graphs (that are based on model).

Each folder contains a replication of a paper: to use them run the file named after the paper (AuthorsYear.m), it will do everything (calling all the other scripts) and generate all the tables and figures as saved files.

These serve two purposes. One is to illustrate how to use the VFI Toolkit, the other is to provide checks on existing results in the Economics literature. 

Submissions of codes replicating papers are most welcome.
